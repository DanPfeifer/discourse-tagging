### discourse-tagging

This plugin provides tag functionality to Discourse. When users create
topics they can optionally attach tags when they feel that categories
do not fully represent.

**This is early in development** - We will likely be changing it quite
a bit before we are comfortable telling everyone to install it.

If you enjoy living on the edge, install the plugin and provide feedback
on [our meta site](http://meta.discourse.org).
